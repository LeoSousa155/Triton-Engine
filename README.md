# Triton Engine

## Description

Triton Engine is a personal C++ project aimed at exploring and learning about game engine development from scratch. Using GLFW for window management and OpenGL for 3D graphics rendering, this project seeks to create a solid foundation for future games and graphical applications.

## Technologies Used

* **C++:** Main programming language.
* **GLFW:** Library for window creation, input, and event handling.
* **OpenGL:** API for 3D graphics rendering.

## How to Compile and Run

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/LeoSousa155/Triton-Engine.git
    cd triton_engine
    ```

2.  Make sure you have CMake installed.

3.  Create a build directory:

    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```

4.  Generate build files with CMake:

    ```bash
    cmake ..
    ```

5.  Compile the project:

    ```bash
    make
    ```

6.  Run the generated executable:

    ```bash
    ./TritonEngine
    ```
